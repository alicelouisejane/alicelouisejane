# Hi, I'm Alice :woman_scientist:

I believe the future and key to progressing scientifically is an interdisciplinary approach to science. Currently undertaking a PhD with Univeristy of Exeter Medical School in type 1 diabetes. 

My current focus:
- Analysis and interpretation of clinical data
- Research uses of Continuous Glucose Monitoring data 
- Glucose trends around exercise in type 1 diabetes 

I also have type 1 diabetes and I am passionate about raising awareness of what it is like to live with.
